        Know me!
        <p>
            I’ve always been intrigued with maths! It began with a problem that says “0!=1” …? Later on, it turned to “Binary Numbers” and how everything is represented by a binary electrical signal that registers in one of two states: on or off in computes. And interesting enough that the two quadrillionth (2*1015) bit of Pi is 0! 
        
             <br>
             I am Donna, big fan of numbers, Big Bang theory and Darwinism (a theory of biological evolution). I've been working as an IT assistant at school. I've been always seeking for an opportunity to dive into programming, coding; and I found "Code Nation" a fancy place to simulate real work/study environment.

        What makes a digital project run successfully?
        <p>
            Digital project management is about getting things done in a digital world.
            Digital project management is about getting things done in a digital world. If you want to complete any project successfully, you need a continual back and forth between team members. They need close collaboration and cooperation. When it comes to digital projects; You should not just be based on user needs. Do research for appropriateness. Be flexible. Have a wish list of functionality that leads to over engineered solutions. Consider time consuming to produce. This slows down the delivery of the project. Make sure there is no confusion over roles. People become defensive when they feel their toes are being trodden on, so take the time to define roles upfront. Managing a project need skills such as: Communication skills Reliable resource and team leader Distributing tasks to team members Setting deadlines Strategically responding to changes and unexpected challenges Updating executives and stakeholders with reports Ensuring the quality of a product Using data to track project success.

        Risk management!

        <p>

            when teams put technology ahead of strategy, before considering the business process implications of the new technology, then errors occur.
            When you don’t define specifically what success looks like for the project and how it affects  the company’s business strategy before moving forward. Also if your digital project plans are not flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given moment.
            Expecting perfection: “done is better than perfect”.
            <br>
            Governance risk relates to board and management performance
            Strategic risks result from errors in strategy, such as choosing a technology that can’t be made to work.
            Operational risk and process problems such as procurement, production, and distribution.
            Market risks include competition, foreign exchange, commodity markets, interest rate risk, and credit risks.
            Legal risks, including contract risks and litigation brought against the organization.
            Risks associated with nature hazards,such as storms, floods, and earthquakes; and more over; terrorism and civil unrest.

        How this tech would help you achieve your outcomes!

        <p>
            GitHub is an open-source repository hosting service, sort of like a cloud for code. It manages changes to a project without overwriting any part of that project. And it’s not going away anytime soon, particularly since Torvalds and his fellow kernel developers employ Git to help develop the core kernel for Linux.
One of the main misconceptions about GitHub is that it’s a development tool, as much a part of coding as computer languages and compilers. GitHub itself isn’t much more than a social network like Facebook or Flickr. You build a profile, upload projects to share and connect with other users by “following” their accounts. And while many users store programs and code projects, also you can keep text documents or other file types in your project folders to show off. A very good feature is when you and a co-worker are both updating pages on the same website; you both are able to make your changes, save them, and upload them back to the website.

        GDPR impact…

        <p>
            General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), came out May 25th 2018, it’s a new legislation coming out of the European Union. Although the law focuses on how you protect individuals personal data; it really is a brilliant piece of legislation that is much higher than protection is companies.
            It really gives legislative guidance to organizations about how to manage and governorate their data that they collect. Knowing what you collect, and how you use it or the right things with it, that’s what this law is.
            It really gives legislative guidance to organizations about how to manage and governorate their data that they collect. Knowing what you collect, and how you use it or the right things with it, that’s what this law is.
            The aim is simple, is to put personal data back in control of individuals, power to the people. The secondary purpose is, gives certainties to companies to comply with data protection laws in the EU, so they only have to comply with a set of privacy rolls.
            But what is the GDPR?
            It reinforces the European’s Notion that privacy is a fundamental human right and by doing that, it creates new rights for individuals.
            So how does it impact companies?
            First of all, it extends far beyond the EU’s borders. If a company offers its services to an EU resident, a law applies, so in essence, pretty much everyone. The second thing is that the risk of non compliance with the law is really high. Companies who think that what’s the risk for me not comply or being in the hurt not getting head of this thing and taking this seriously; enforcements are going to be rebus and is going to be serious and then going to be out of the gates and penalties for non-companies depending on a transgration can be as high as up to 4% a companies global gross revenue or up to €20 million which are huge numbers.
            What is the law all about?
            It really is requiring companies due to two things;
            To be respectful and look at the world at all of the practices.
            Get a full picture of comprehensive understanding of what they collect and how they use it, and how these little bits of data flow through the organizations.

        Bugs and Faults!

        <p>
            Before you start looking at the individual web accessibility guidelines, we recommend educating yourself and your staff on how individuals with disabilities access the internet and the hurdles they often face. This will help you understand why the guidelines are written as they are and can also be very useful in helping you establish your web accessibility process. Let's start with accessibility issues that users with visual impairments face, which are issues with: Layout Headings Navigation Non-HTML content JavaScript Missing or inaccurate alt text Bad form structure Those with visual impairments use screen readers to access the internet. A screen reader is a type of software which works with the operating system to provide information about icons, menus, files, folders, and dialogue boxes. Since screen readers don’t rely on a mouse, they generally operate by responding to various keyboard commands. For example, a command may allow a reader to navigate a web page, to read part of a document, or make a selection. All operating systems now come with screen readers. There are also some commercial screen readers, such as the popular JAWS software.

        The appropriate file types for websites.

        <p>
            All images are made up from either raster or vector file types. Raster images are built through a series of pixels, whereas vector files are built using proportional formulas. Every photograph you see on any website will be a raster image and will be saved as either a JPEG, PNG or GIF. Vector images, on the other hand, are more complex and are typically saved as an SVG. They differ from raster images as they are not known to work well with photographs, instead they are perfect for graphics that require frequent resizing such as logos. JPEGs are probably the best file format for photographs on the web as the level of flexible compression when saving means they are capable of shrinking to a smaller file size and, therefore, they won’t have a negative effect on page speed. For example, a compressed 80KB image won’t take as long to load as a 8MB image as its smaller size means it requires less resources to load.
