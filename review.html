    <p>2.1) Trello helped me to organize my tasks; not only I was able to follow my checklist, but also boosted my confidence by showing me how much progress I made at the time!
Visual Studio Code is easy to work with, accessible on
both mac and any other pcs. On the other hand, it gives you a better view of
your coding because of its high quality vision studio!

<br>
</br>
<br>
</br>

2.2) On my PC I did coding on Notepad and Free JavaScript Editor software, which I don't recommend them. They aren’t fancy at all, by that I mean after an hour they can be a real pain!
By Trello is easy to manage authority of members, adding or removing members.   Easily you can add, modify, remove and discuss tasks and issues. And the tasks and issue have to be displayed clearly.  
On the other hand, it’s free! It looks like an App, not a site. And real time updates is amazingly fast!
But You can’t write documents or wiki about board (at least I couldn’t!), only simple description, with No calendar.
VS Code is a very powerful text editor that is built by Microsoft. As I said, prefer it over the listed text editors (fancy vast array of features). As a beginner, function definitions and smart completion make coding more fun and easier to learn.

2.3)  How to play to your strengths to your projects?
 I’ve done multiple tasks with multiple skills, with different styles, by using variety of tech tools, and find other ways to collaborate and resources! It took a little bit of discovery, time and effort in order to find out what those are. It was a result oriented.
There were some good resources, which Trello was one of the them.
I am very good at looking at details to bring different pieces together, but I wasn’t have this feature in my web; and that’s why I’m still unhappy with result!
I’d like to use Trello more often as my project manager and leading tool (done tasks are motivated).  Again the deliverables of my website couldn’t produce all the time and effort I’d put on it.
In initiating the web, I had some high level of ideas, but I couldn’t figure it out how I wanna going to about the solutions!
Another weakness of mine in these project was about the dependency of tasks, the milestones and how they ought to be done.
Monitoring and controlling, producing detailed reports and tracking details, and then closing; really rap up things to make sure everything meets the project needs. So I can say I leverage different part of my strength and weaknesses! Like in a team, I wanna partner with someone who good at the priority of tasks and keep things up. 

<br>
</br>
<br>
</br>

2.4) I lost focus on MY project when I’ve left too much time with my critical project resources. So for the next time, I’ll make a big-picture of my ideal project done. I’ll ask myself;
What tasks involve?
What I am gonna achieve?
How can I get them done properly? What tools could help me to get them done more efficiently/ faster? Like Voice Dictation- as I heart my ankle and typing was such a pain, long lasting process for me!

<br>
</br>
<br>
</br>

3.1) I’ve tried different tools which they have their pros and cons. Some of them like notepad for coding is not that much appropriated although in absence of other tools, is efficient.
I should have dictated myself instead of spending days for typing. (I learnt my lesson in a very hard way!)
Trello is such a good technology. It is not only a proper way to manage duties or modify issues in work projects, but also so handy to make yourself committed to your personal life. (which I’m using it as a checklist regularly)
Visual Studio Code is easy to use just after two or three times coding and running, you will get used to it, beside an amazing smart completion idea.
But the problem arises when errors! What is the error and how to fix it, is not intelligible enough!
To recap, most technologies collected by the author relating to IT issues and solving problems, is made available and free to the public. (At least there are some free version of them!)
I am happy to keep learning and diving more in them in my both personal life and tech/IT projects.
They were convenience, almost free and accurate. I enjoyed the format, layout, structure and quality of them.
Working as a team it could a bless or a nightmare. Yet I learnt is that you need a team leader, not some body bossy, but a person who can keep contacting with team-workers to manage duties and times.
Individual projects made us face our abilities- strengths and weaknesses- we all had some experiences by now; so I would like to do it as a team for next project.

3.2) Making the most of your time is critical. According to my personal experience, instead of putting efforts in more hours, I will work smarter.
·       I will set self-imposed deadlines, so I will limit time I’m spending on tasks.
·       I will give up on the perfection!
·       I’ll try to be more proactive instead of being reactive.
·       I will keep listening to music as I’m working to boost my productivity.
·       I will prioritize my tasks ahead of time, indeed.
·       I will use technologies tools smarter!
·       I learnt to skip when I read!
·       I will organize my google docs by more proper names and headings!
·       Funny enough, I will learn keyboard shortcuts!

3.3) The use of IT tools and systems improved the productivity and efficiency of my work activities in all of contexts. Every task or context requires some preparation, clarification or research to identify what factors need to be considered, like, time available, source, types of contents and technologies.
I will remind myself techniques required will involve a number of steps and a time!
I will gather information to make more clear picture of my goals, analyse information about whether the IT tools and techniques are appropriate to the task and intended outcomes.
<br>
Mark Twain once said, "eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day." I’ll do that from Now On!
</br>
I’m more productivity if I do single-task!
<br>
Every evening, I make a to-do lists on Trello as a great productivity tool in order to stay organized and focused.
</br>
I will take advantage of my commute by using Slack, more often and
more efficient!
Next time, I will make an app on my own and will design a web in a team!

<br>

3.4) As digital environments are facing a continually rapidly changing, digital projects need to adopt within a very short of time.
So we always need to develop new ideas that meet our demands and goals.
There is extensive experience of Java, .NET and other programming languagessuch as Drupal and Magento, Sogeti can support all of our application development projects.
I will choose different browsers across different devices.
I will develop them for different browsers and screen sizes.
I will Performance of different networks differs and security settings, such as 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi.
I will Stay in touch more often with other colleagues, learners and author during the project in more proper way.
